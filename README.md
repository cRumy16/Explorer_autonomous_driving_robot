# Explorer_autonomous_driving_robot
Autonomous robot for the national RomeCup - Explorer 2019 competition. The robot was conceived and constructed entirely by the team, including 3D printed components and Arduino microcontroller programming. The competition task involved the robot autonomously navigating an arena to find randomly placed sources of light, gas, and sound while avoiding obstacles. The project provided hands-on experience in robotics development and team collaboration to achieve a complex technical goal under time constraints. Participation in the national competition marked a capstone learning experience applying science and engineering principles.
